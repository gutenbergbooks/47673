<h2 id="c1">The Pinos Altos Story</h2>
<p>Pinos Altos, the oldest Anglo settlement in Grant County,
is a small town in southwestern New Mexico. It lies across the
Continental Divide at an altitude of just over 7000 feet, between the
Diablo Range to the north and east and the Pinos Altos Mountains
to the south and west. Bear Creek begins in the Pinos Altos
Mountains and flowing north divides the town, joining the Gila
River near the town of Gila, twenty miles away as the crow flies.
Whiskey Creek has its source in the Diablos, skirts the town on the
east and by devious means finds its way to the Rio Grande. It is in
a transitional zone where Ponderosa pine and junipers, pinon and
scrub oak meet. There was a time when the site was covered with
tall pines, when springs bubbled to the surface, and the arroyos ran
with water. Ruins of pit houses and the number of shards and
artifacts found in the vicinity indicate that a prehistoric people lived
here before the coming of the white man.</p>
<p>In the archives of the Mexican Government in Chihuahua,
it is said, there are records of the discovery of gold in the Pinos Altos
Mountains by General Pedro Almendaris, a commandant at Santa
Rita, and of shipments of gold received there from San Domingo
Creek in 1837. The laborers at Santa Rita were convicts for the most
part and a small garrison of soldiers was stationed there to guard
the convicts and also to protect them from the Indians. No doubt
in the performance of their duties they scouted this far afield.</p>
<p>There is a legend that Mexicans finding gold here built a
small but strong encampment of logs, rocks, and adobe which they
called &ldquo;Pinos Altos&rdquo;. The wall was built in the form of a horseshoe
with the only opening at the narrow end. Inside were shelters for
men and animals and a living spring at the foot of a large cottonwood
tree. Men and animals lived inside the enclosure but went
outside every day and while the men placered the animals grazed.
At day&rsquo;s end the workings were carefully concealed and all returned
to camp and barricaded the opening for the night. Day by day more
gold was added to the rawhide panniers. At last the time came
when the gold must be taken to Mexico. There is something about
the precious metal that incites greed and envy. The men disagreed
as to whom would take the gold to far away Chihuahua, and who
would stay to protect the camp and continue working. Each man
distrusted the other. The story does not tell what happened&mdash;whether
all went and were ambushed and destroyed by the unfriendly
Indians, or whether while they quarreled the Indians found them
with their guards down. Perhaps like &ldquo;the gingham dog and the
calico cat&rdquo;, they &ldquo;ate each other up&rdquo;. The story simply ends by
saying that they disappeared and that nothing was left but the
horseshoe-shaped ruins around the spring at the foot of the cottonwood
tree. Such is the legend of Pinos Altos Primero.</p>

<h2 id="c2">Early History</h2>
<p>Early one spring a party of twelve scouts left Tucson for the
Rio Grande. When they reached Mesilla they decided to prospect
in the mountains to the northwest. They stopped in Santa Rita to
replenish supplies and then moved westward. On May 18, 1860,
three prospectors, from that party, named Birch, Snively and Hicks,
camped on what is now known as Bear Creek. Birch went to the
stream for water and found chispas&mdash;small nuggets of gold, in the
bed of the stream. Scooping up a handful he returned to his
companions. Then began a frantic exploration of Bear Creek and
every nearby gulch. Their findings were sufficient to justify the
establishment of a more permanent camp but additional tools and
supplies were needed. They went to Santa Rita where they confided
their discovery to the Marston brothers and Langston whom they
found working there. Returning, they christened their camp &ldquo;Birchville&rdquo;
in honor of the discoverer and erected structures more adequate
for comfort and protection. They were joined by the three Americans
who knew of their discovery, and by many others, both American
and Mexican, for the secret was out. By September there were 700
men in the field and a few families of the Mexican miners. While
Santa Rita could supply staples, it was necessary to go to Mesilla for
hardware, clothing, groceries in quantity, which they paid for with
1 &middot; 2 or 3 fingers of gold. The first year was spent placer mining
and prospecting to find the &ldquo;mother lode&rdquo;. The Apaches were very
troublesome, confining their activities to waylaying small parties,
the driving off of stock, and to gathering on the hills above the
workers, taunting the &ldquo;Goddammies&rdquo; as they called the Americans,
from the words heard frequently from the men. The second year
a few lodes were located but only the surface was scratched. Quartz
bearing ore was crushed in arrastras, century-old mills such as the
Egyptians and Phoenicians had used to crush olives for oil and
grapes for wine, and which had come down through the ages to the
Mexicans. A circular pit was dug, sides and bottom lined with flat
stones, a stout pole was placed in the center to which an arm was
attached and a burro, mule or horse could be hitched. Heavy rounded
boulders were placed in the pit and attached to the other end of
the arm. The quartz was thrown into the pit and broken up as the
beast walked around and around. The rubble was thrown out and
the bottom scraped of the fine material which was then washed in
the ordinary rocker. (Only one arrastra in good condition is intact
today). As more and more miners came in the settlement moved up
the creek to a more central location for all placer grounds. The
Mesilla Times in 1861 carried items and advertisements from the
gold camp. It stated that &ldquo;Thomas J. Marston was pushing ahead
his work of grinding quartz and doing well although constantly
annoyed by Indians,&rdquo; that, &ldquo;The Pinos Altos Hotel served bread and
meals,&rdquo; that &ldquo;Samuel G. and Roy Bean (Law West of the Pecos) were
dealers in merchandise and liquors and had a fine billiard table&rdquo;,
and that &ldquo;Thos. Marston wanted 200 quartz miners at $1.00 and $2.00
a day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>With the establishment of the Confederacy this part of the
West was claimed by the South. On August 1, 1861, Col. John R.
Baylor as Governor at Mesilla, proclaimed the establishment of the
Territory of Arizona. This included the part of New Mexico below
the 34th parallel. Miners had been asking the United States
Government for military protection but little action had been taken.
However, Governor Baylor recognized the importance of controlling
the Indians and of protecting the scattered inhabitants. Captain
Snively&rsquo;s Arizona Guards were assigned to watch the Apaches under
Cochise and Mangas Colorado, and Thomas Marston was named
Captain in the Arizona Scouts with nine men under his control to
protect Birchville. At the same time he appointed Justices of the
Peace for Dona Ana County, which then included Dona Ana, Luna,
Hidalgo and Grant. Among them was M. M. Steinhal of Birchville,
who became the first Justice of Peace in what is now Grant County.
The Apaches were determined to drive all Americans from their
land. Cochise brought his warriors from the Chiricahuas and joined
Mangas Colorado and his Mimbrenos for a concerted attack on the
miners. Cochise was in command. Early on the morning of
September 22, 1861, 400 Apaches made a bold, but unsuccessful
attempt to destroy the camp and drive the miners out. The conflict
raged along the Continental Divide until one o&rsquo;clock, when with
fifteen Apaches killed, one by a dog belonging to a Mexican named
Carlos Norero, the Indians withdrew. Three Americans lost their
lives, including Thomas Marston who had been fatally wounded and
died a few days later. He was buried beneath the large juniper tree
in the Pinos Altos cemetery. Many of the remaining Americans
decided that their scalps were more valuable than gold and left to
join either the Union or Confederate Forces. The Beans were among
them. On October 10th Governor Baylor responded to a desperate
call for help from the weakened settlement by sending a detachment
of 100 men under Major E. Waller to relieve the miners and to
protect their rich workings.</p>
<p>Not all the trouble during the year 1861 was with the
Indians. A man named Taylor held a grudge against William Dike,
who was in the employ of the Overland Express Company. At a
baile on Christmas Eve, Taylor gathered some friends about him and
fired at Dike, who was dancing. Several shots were exchanged,
Dike was killed and Taylor wounded. However, he was able to
escape into Mexico. This was the first murder in the camp.</p>
<p>Jack Swilling, who had been among the first people to come
to the camp, enlisted with the Confederate Army, was commissioned
a lieutenant and assigned to protect the settlement. He was very
popular with Americans and Mexicans alike. He had been friendly
with Mangas Colorado and once was accredited with saving the
chief&rsquo;s life. One night, in a drunken brawl, he shot and killed his
best friend&mdash;a man named Printer. This friend was buried in the
cemetery near Captain Marston but his grave was not marked.
People of the camp, thinking that Swilling&rsquo;s shock and grief were
sufficient punishment, did nothing about the affair. Later Swilling
went to Arizona where he started the development of the Salt River
Valley. However, when in 1867, Dan Diamond, over a trivial matter
and in cold blood, killed Schwartz, a butcher, the men took action.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
The nearest court was at Mesilla so they decided to give Diamond a
fair trial. He was permitted to select his own jury and a man to
defend him. He was found guilty as charged and sentenced to
hang. Sunrise next day saw him hanging from a large juniper tree
on the &ldquo;Mill Site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mangas Colorado was a wise and worried chief of the Warm
Spring Apaches, and he was getting old. He had watched the hard
rock miners at Santa Rita and the slow-moving pipe-smoking &ldquo;Los
Goddammies&rdquo; in the arroyas in the Pinos Altos mountains and noted
that they came in ever increasing numbers, that every day parties
of hunters were killing deer, antelope and turkey and driving game
farther back into the mountains. He wondered what would become
of his people. He went to parley with the miners and learned that
they were interested only in obtaining the bright metal. In an effort
to get them to leave the country he offered to lead them to a rich
gold field south of the border which Victorio had found. On one
occasion he was bound and whipped, which he said he &ldquo;could never
forgive&rdquo;. As he was let go one husky miner, who had been tormenting
him, called, &ldquo;Send over Apache girls, no whip their backs&rdquo;. He went
to a secret place where he rested and recuperated from his injuries,
sick with humiliation and bitter about the loss of his son and of his
friends through the treachery of the Americans. A plan formed in
his mind. Returning to Warm Springs, he began his preparations.
He sent for Cochise &ldquo;Not for war but for counsel&rdquo;. Cochise told
of long wagon trains coming into the country with more and more
men. If ever the miners were to be driven out now was the time.
Cochise returned to his mountains. Mangas Colorado had the herds
brought in and driven to secret places, braves and women were
given instructions, and suddenly Warm Springs was deserted. One
day, on the long slope above the miners&rsquo; camp, a bevy of Apache
girls and young squaws appeared. They paid no attention to the
settlement nor to the miners who were working nearby, but combed
and braided their long hair. Once in a while the girls left the group
to run and play among the rocks and then went back to combing
their hair. The miners called to them but they did not answer.
Evening came when all the miners returned to camp. The sight of
the women so excited the men that they forgot their camp chores
and charged up the hill. At the same time the mules were stampeded,
hunting parties that had been out for game for the camp
were ambushed, and a volley of shots came from across the canyon.
Forty of the miners were killed or wounded. One hunter who escaped
the ambush reported that an overwhelming number of Apaches were
in the wooded hills. Apache like, they did not follow up their
advantage but withdrew. This episode and the War between the
States caused more of the Americans to leave. &ldquo;They will come
again,&rdquo; said Mangas Colorado.</p>
<p>Word was sent by General Carleton at Fort Bowie to General
Joseph West to arrange for the capture of &ldquo;the bloodiest of Apache
chiefs&rdquo;, to &ldquo;take him dead or alive, by force or strategy&rdquo;. Captain
Shirland, with the aid of Jack Swilling, located Mangas Colorado
in the Pinos Altos Mountains. When told that General West wanted
to have a peace talk with him, the chief went willingly and without
his warriors. On January 17, 1863, he was taken as a prisoner, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Captain Shirland of the 1st California Cavalry at Fort McLane. The
official records say that &ldquo;he was killed the following day by a guard
while attempting to escape.&rdquo; The records in Washington also stated
that &ldquo;the wife of Mangas Colorado was killed, along with ten other
Indians by Captain William McCleave, of the 1st California Cavalry
at the Pinos Altos Mines on January 19, 1863&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The next year an enterprising young man, Pete Nest, left
camp to go to El Paso where he bought a barrel of whiskey. All
went well on his way back until he reached the creek east of camp
where he had a breakdown. He managed to get word in and the
boys went down the trail with their tin cups. Nest said that he netted
about $800.00 in cash and gold. There are many stories of how the
creek got its name but this one is most reliable. Many years later
the good people ranching down the valley petitioned the legislature
to have the name changed. The bill was introduced by the senator
from this district. Some wag suggested &ldquo;Cedarbrook&rdquo;, that being
the senator&rsquo;s favorite brand. The name was changed to Arenas
Valley but the people at this end prefer &ldquo;Whiskey&rdquo; to &ldquo;Arenas&rdquo; (sand).</p>
<p>There was a strong feeling of enmity between the Southerners&mdash;most
of whom had come from Texas&mdash;and the Mexicans. In
February of the following year a dispute about the locating of mining
claims arose. The Americans insisted that the Mexicans should not
be allowed to locate claims along the main gulches. The Mexicans,
believing themselves to be the stronger group, made plans to take
the camp. Don Manuel Leguinazabal prevailed upon them to desist
so what might have been a bloody conflict was averted. The Indians
continued to attack small parties and to steal stock so the two groups
forgot their differences and united against the common enemy. For
many months there were no major calamities for the Mexicans had
made a treaty with the Indians who frequently came to the camp to
beg for tobacco or to trade. Some bright mind conceived the idea
late in the summer of &rsquo;64 to have a fiesta to celebrate the treaty of
peace and to invite the Indians. A fine dinner of beans and other
dishes was served to sixty Apaches in a house, since destroyed, but
which stood near the present home of Miss Recene Ashton. While
the beans were being enjoyed the dastardly hosts opened fire, killing
several of the guests, others escaped with all trust in the settlers
destroyed. Woe to anyone who wandered from camp from that
time on. Virgil Marston took a chance and was killed on Whiskey
Creek. He was buried beside his brother. But the danger did not
keep other men from coming. After the war many of the men who
had gone to fight came back.</p>
<p>When the California Column had been disbanded at Mesilla
many of its members came to the settlement as &ldquo;Indian fighters&rdquo; and
to make their fortunes in the gold camp. In 1866 the name
&ldquo;Birchville&rdquo; was changed to the original name of &ldquo;Pinos Altos&rdquo;. To
many the climate and the beauty of the country made a strong appeal
and they considered making permanent homes. There were no
American women in the settlement so many men took Mexican and
Indian girls as their common law wives, built log or adobe homes
and founded families that have been prominent in the history of
the Southwest. Perhaps a touch of homesickness made them yearn
for familiar things. They sent to former homes for seeds and trees
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
and planted orchards, vineyards and gardens on their claims where
they had built homes. Some did not stake out claims but built on
open ground, holding it by &ldquo;Squatters&rsquo; Rights&rdquo;. Messrs. Houston and
Thomas located several claims down Bear Creek and made of the
home place a garden spot. Their apple orchard was the first in Grant
County. Moore, Stanley, Barton, Adair and Handy also planted
orchards and vineyards. There were fields of alfalfa, corn and beans,
and smaller plots of garden truck and flowers. Besides his terraced
grape vines and fruit trees Mr. Stanley had a rose garden. The
Mexicans planted almond and peach trees around their homes and
invariably had oleanders in wooden tubs. During the summer they
blossomed beside the doorways and somehow room was found for
them inside the small dwellings when frost came. They took
fledgling mocking birds from nests and carefully tended and trained
them. They were kept in large cages hanging outside on the wall
or from a tree where they called and exchanged confidences with
the neighboring birds or complemented the guitar music. Each home
had a small corral for the burro. Chickens and cows roamed at will
and here and there goats would clamber over walls and roofs. Every
day the yard was swept as clean as the mud packed floors of their
dwellings. Peter Wagnor and John Simon brought wild roses from
the canyons and planted hedges of them around their homes.
Although the buildings were crude the general impression was
pleasing. While this was begun in the late 60&rsquo;s it stretched over
many years.</p>
<p>A band of Navajos succeeded in driving off 31 yoke of oxen
belonging to Hartford and Groves on the night of June 16, 1867. A
company of 50 men under the command of Richard Hudson, (a
member of the California Column and an uncle, by marriage, of Mrs.
Robert K. Bell) took the trail and followed it for eight days before
they came upon the band. In the running fight thirteen Navajos
were killed and seven taken as prisoners. Hudson reported that
one of his men had a cheek grazed by a bullet. This is the only
record of the camp being raided by any Indians other than Apaches.</p>
<p>After the war the policy of the government regarding the
West changed. The point that affected the Southwest most was the
establishing of forts to protect travel and trade&mdash;even to protect the
miners at Pinos Altos. In the general field orders for the establishing
of forts it was stated &ldquo;that one was to be in the vicinity of Pinos
Altos, to consist of one company of infantry and two of cavalry to
protect the miners of southwest New Mexico from the Warm Springs
Apaches.&rdquo; The Military Reservation of Fort Bayard was established
in 1869.</p>
<p>All during the &rsquo;60&rsquo;s supplies had to be brought in by pack
trains over rough trails. The 10 mile trail to Santa Rita was the
most direct line crossing above present Fort Bayard and across the
mountains to Whiskey Creek. The pack trains from Mesilla left
the main road to Santa Rita at Fort McLane (Apache Tejo) and came
straight to camp. Game was plentiful but hunters had to be sent
out daily to keep the people supplied with meat. It was never safe
for one man to hunt alone so small parties took turns with the
understanding that the venison, bear and other game would be
shared by all. The Hill Brothers left the camp to ranch on the Gila
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
at what was known for years as the Hill and later the Gila Hot
Springs (now Doc Campbell&rsquo;s). There they raised vegetables and
made jerky of venison which were brought to camp. James McKenna,
author of Black Range Tales, engaged in such trade. The miners
made periodic trips to the springs to bathe and sweat out the grime,
smoke and the effects of bad whiskey. In 1868 Ancheta had a trading
post in the original part of the old store building which burned in
1957. The handmade wrought iron box found in the ruins may have
been his strong box. That same year he operated an arrastra, the
remains of which can still be seen on the &ldquo;Mill Site&rdquo; now belonging
to L. E. Nichols.</p>
<p>Mr. Robert K. Bell, as a boy, lived at the Ancheta Ranch,
(the Ward Lodge in Little Cherry) and he told the story of the
original stone house. Sr. Ancheta had taken up land near the Twin
Sisters and had a goat ranch. This land is said to be the first land
patented in Grant County. Ancheta went to Mexico for a visit and
was a guest at an hacienda where he fell in love with the wife of
his host. He persuaded her to run away with him and come to Pinos
Altos. The house was built for her. The port holes were designed
to keep off the pursuing husband and relatives as well as the Indians.</p>
<p>There was no formal organization, nor survey made of the
camp until 1867. Anson Mills, later a prominent figure in the history
of El Paso, was sent by a member of the famous Maverick family
to make a mineral survey and report of this district. Evidently Mills&rsquo;
report was not satisfactory to Mr. Maverick for he took no further
interest in this section but Mills stayed. The residents felt that to
make their rights to improvements secure they should take legal
action so a Pinos Altos Town Company was organized. It had hired
Mills to survey and plot the town conforming to government survey
lines. According to the file in the county courthouse, transferred
to Grant from Dona Ana, &ldquo;streets had been laid off and graded, four
bridges built over Bear Creek, and some wells sunk&rdquo;. The file also
states that &ldquo;The first settlement had been made in 1860. In 1868 it
had 600 to 700 inhabitants, 120 houses, two stamp mills, a number of
arrastras, three furnaces for smelting silver, two hotels, and several
mercantile establishments.&rdquo; Incidentally, there were seven saloons,
but instead of being listed separately they may have been classed as
&ldquo;mercantile&rdquo; establishments. &ldquo;The town embraced 320 acres, twenty
miles from the Gila River and 110 from the Rio Grande by the nearest
traveled road.&rdquo; The town company was incorporated and the deed
signed by &ldquo;Samuel J. Jones, vice president, acting for persons&rdquo; and
dated July 3, 1868. Grant County was formed from Dona Ana that
same year and Pinos Altos was made the county seat, 1869-1871. The
county&rsquo;s first court house is now owned by Mrs. Mabel Eckerd of
Lordsburg. Only one term of court was held, presided over by
Judge H. B. Johnson. It has been described as &ldquo;the gayest and
loudest ever held in the Rocky Mountain region.&rdquo; A band furnished
music, refreshments were handy, and two condemned men were
taken out and hanged from the same tree where Dan Diamond met
his fate.</p>
<p>Trolius Stephens brought his wife overland by mule train
from Nebraska in 1873. She was the first, and for several years,
the only American woman in town, excepting Miss Parker who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
been here eleven years before. They were the grandparents of Cecil
Stephens of Arenas Valley. Both Mr. and Mrs. Stephens were
interested in welfare of the people, they visited the sick, cared for the
injured, and saw to it that no family was cold or hungry. He contended
that a man was worth but $1.25 a day from the neck down
but that there was no limit to his worth from the neck up. He paid
accordingly. He could not or would not tolerate stealing. On one
occasion when he noticed that wood was disappearing from the
town&rsquo;s large wood yard, and the man in charge of it said that he
did not know how, when, or by whom, Mr. Stephens said he would
&ldquo;fix the guy.&rdquo; He bored holes in several sticks of wood and put in
dynamite. Before sunrise the next morning a mighty blast shook
the town. Mr. Stephens rushed out and saw a roof rising into the
brightening sky and above were several black disks, the lids from
the kitchen stove&mdash;in the home of his cousin.</p>
<p>Fuel for homes and mills was juniper and oak wood cut in
the hills into cord lengths and packed into town by burros. Ore
from the mines was taken to the mills in the same manner. Often
there were as many as twenty burros to a train. The trails they
used still stand out on the mountain sides, as do the old roads from
the saw mills, where the logs were hauled out by oxen. Among the
names of men who operated early sawmills are Ripley, Scott,
McMillan, Brownell and Franey, who came in &rsquo;81 or &rsquo;82. He was
joined in 1902 by his nephew, Thomas Foy, a rosy cheeked boy fresh
from old Ireland. Later there were Davidson, Slack, Leonard, Mason
and others.</p>
<p>From the earliest days when both Mexicans and Americans
traveled through the country they would camp at the springs the
Mexicans had called Cienega de San Vicente. Miners from Pinos
Altos tried raising corn and beans there, but being loathe to leave
their diggings to care for the crops, Indians or animals destroyed
them. Captain A. J. Hulburt, more daring and persistent than other
miners, built a cabin and took his Mexican wife there to live during
the growing season. He would ride to and from his mine, the &ldquo;Texas&rdquo;
on the western slope of the mountain, a distance of seven miles. One
day he left his rifle at the cabin with his wife and son and went out
to plow his field. Looking up he saw Apaches between himself and
the house. Knowing he could not rescue his family he ran to the
mines, hoping his wife would be able to stand off the marauders
until he could get help. Almost exhausted he gasped out his story.
The men grabbed their guns, mounted their animals and hurried to
the cabin, only to find it smouldering, the wife and son dead, and the
Indians gone.</p>
<p>When this place was selected as a town site in 1872 and
was named &ldquo;Silver City&rdquo;, Dick Hudson remarked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hell of
a name to give a town on a mud flat.&rdquo; Later he wrote, &ldquo;The only
rival the Tall Pine City is ever destined to have sprang into existence
as if by magic&rdquo;. He was wrong in his use of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;. A
quarter of a century later a writer in The Enterprise referred to
Pinos Altos as &ldquo;an abandoned camp in Silver City&rsquo;s back yard&rdquo;. He,
too, used one wrong word&mdash;&ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;. The opening of mines to
the south and west drew many miners away and more adventurers
were attracted to this district. Many of these men wanted to get rich
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
quick and engaged in illicit mining deals. The result was that many
claims were not being worked. The newcomers were more inclined
to gamble than to use a pick and shovel. It was helpful to have a
nearer source of supplies but the cost was just as great and business
declined. In those days ox teams would leave Pinos Altos in midmorning
and camp at the Half-Way Rock for the night. Early the
next morning they would proceed to Silver City where the wagons
were loaded, then they came back to the Half-Way camp and on to
Pinos Altos the third day. Once a band of Apaches attacked but
were unsuccessful. Another time they swooped down on the stage
between the old Brent Ranch and Pinon Hill, wounding the driver
and killing one mule. &ldquo;Chinamen&rdquo; were among the passengers and
they put up such a good fight that the Indians rode off. Old &ldquo;One-Armed-Juan&rdquo;
Esquejeda told of having goats taken from his place
almost in the center of town and about the same time Willie Fletcher
and some of his pals went swimming in a pool formed by a dam in
Arroya Rico. Their scattered clothing was left on a bank. A group
of young braves came down the gulch and stood watching the
splashing boys. They gathered up the clothing and departed. The
boys waited until dark before slipping home. Some time during the
&rsquo;70&rsquo;s Silvario Gutierrez returned to his family after having been a
captive of the Apaches for seven years. His family had given him
up for dead and although he had been very small when captured he,
fortunately, remembered his &ldquo;pet&rdquo; name. He was the grandfather
of Manuel Gutierrez of Santa Rita and of Virginia Terrazas and Nora
Garcia.</p>
<p>Placer mining no longer yielded such rich returns. Many
placer and lode claims were abandoned, and except for gambling
and dance hall brawls things were considered quiet during the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c3">80&rsquo;s And 90&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>The next two decades were of increasing prosperity, thanks
to the efforts of Trolius Stephens and Nathaniel Bell. Not only was
there greater mining activity but new businesses were opened. The
Ancheta Trading Post had been bought by Bell and Stephens and
enlarged into a general merchandise store which handled everything
from hair pins to machinery. They subsidized a drug store, a barber
shop, and a meat market which had its own slaughter house. Other
merchants opened clothing stores&mdash;general and &ldquo;for men only.&rdquo; The
town boasted a band, a baseball team, and a Turkish Bath. Two new
hotels were built&mdash;The Palmer House and the Pacific. New and
larger homes were erected, more orchards planted. Trees, many of
them maples, were planted along the streets. Because animals roamed
into town, each tree was enclosed to the height of five or six feet.
More saloons and gambling halls were added until they numbered
fourteen. There was no &ldquo;red light&rdquo; district but &ldquo;fancy ladies&rdquo; came
up from Silver City every pay day and two houses were their headquarters.
Whenever a Mexican family could serve enchiladas a
lantern would be hung outside. Mrs. Handy&rsquo;s lantern would be out
every Saturday night. Her enchiladas were considered the best made
any where and her Arbuckle coffee was ambrosia.</p>
<p>So great was the influx of new arrivals during the &rsquo;80&rsquo;s and
&rsquo;90&rsquo;s that two stages&mdash;and sometimes more, made regular round trips
to Silver City to carry passengers and mail.</p>
<p>Chinese had been among the early settlers and they lived
in dug-outs along the gulches. They foresaw that cooking for the
miners and washing for them would be more profitable than placering
so they discarded their gold pans for dish pans and wash tubs. Many
stayed for years operating eating houses, laundries, and hop joints.
See Hop was a general favorite. He loved children and was always
ready to &ldquo;baby-sit&rdquo;. No baby was born but See Hop went to see it,
bearing a gift. On the Chinese New Year he would distribute Chinese
candy and lichee nuts to the children and Chinese lily bulbs to the
mothers. He had a wife and children in China and his ambition was
to make a fortune and return to them. He lost his first savings in
the failure of a Silver City bank so would not trust his money to a
bank again. He hid it in his house and was robbed. Later, in Santa
Rita, trusting neither house nor bank, he buried it and a flood washed
it away. Again he started saving and when he had enough for
passage he went home to China&mdash;an old man. While he was in Pinos
Altos he decided that he would like to give up his laundry and go
into the chicken business. W. E. Watson bought the chickens to
start him. All went well for a time then the chickens began to die.
Nothing he did changed the situation. Papers with Chinese characters
on them were posted on all gates and doors. The chickens
continued to die. A Mexican came by and asked about the papers.
See Hop told him they were notices to the evil spirits. The visitor
laughed and told him to put crosses on every high point where they
could be seen because the devils here could not read Chinese. Still,
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
no desired results. In despair See Hop went to the one who had
bought the stock in the first place and said, &ldquo;You write letters to the
bad spirits in English. Say they belong to Billy Watson. They do
not know Chinese and they do not understand crosses. You tell
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With so many animals needed for power and transportation
corrals were built at the edge of town. &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; wire had not come
into use but there was plenty of bailing wire&mdash;&ldquo;one of the two good
things,&rdquo; the Indians said, &ldquo;that the White Man brought into the
country.&rdquo; Juniper posts in an upright position were set into the
ground as closely as possible and wired together at the top. There
were miles of such fences to enclose the oxen and burro trains. There
were livery stables, carpentry shops, planing mills, dance halls, and
from the very beginning, the necessary blacksmith shops. &ldquo;The
Pinos Altos Miner&rdquo; made its appearance on July 11, 1888, with Mr.
John C. Bayne (grandfather of Clarence Bayne of Silver City) as
editor. Mr. Bayne had been attracted by reports of the mining
activity and came expecting to mine, but having been a newspaper
man he could not resist the appeal for a local paper. It was published
for several years. Later &ldquo;The Pinos Altos,&rdquo; a strictly local and
mining journal, of which Galloway and Warner were the proprietors,
was published.</p>
<p>Mr. George D. Lincoln left Silver City to open a law office
in Pinos Altos. One of his clients was a man known only as &ldquo;Adobe
Bill&rdquo;. He had a Mexican wife and several children. Being unable
to pay the lawyer&rsquo;s fee in gold or cash, he gave his two sons to Mr.
Lincoln who refused to accept them as payment. One day the sheriff
came looking for &ldquo;Dobe Bill&rdquo;, and everyone thought the law had
caught up with the man, but it turned out that he was William Ferris
and he had inherited a large sum of money. &ldquo;Dobe&rdquo; sweated years
of accumulated grime out in a Turkish bath, had a shave and a
hair-cut, bought himself the loudest suit to be obtained, deserted his
family, and departed.</p>
<p>Many nationalities were represented, and until the &rsquo;80&rsquo;s they
mingled freely. When Bell and Stephens advertised for &ldquo;hard rock&rdquo;
miners, a Cornishman told Mr. Stephens he knew a good man, his
&ldquo;Cousin Jack in the Old Country&rdquo;. &ldquo;Send for him,&rdquo; Mr. Stephens
said. Cousin Jack came and he had a &ldquo;Cousin Jack.&rdquo; Soon the
&ldquo;Cousin Jacks&rdquo; were flocking in. It was natural that they should get
together. They built their homes up the hill to the southwest of
town&mdash;seven or eight houses clustered about a large rooming and
boarding house run by Mr. and Mrs. Noah Climo. People down town
referred to it as &ldquo;Cornishtown&rdquo;. The Italians formed their group
and selected a site to the west. It was known as Italian Town. The
newer Mexicans were allowed to build only on the outskirts. They
choose the Continental Divide and the ridge to the east of town
where they had hand-ball courts and cock pits. No longer did the
groups meet socially. The Mexicans had their bailes and fiestas,
from which, unless he was there by special invitation, a &ldquo;white man&rdquo;
was thrown out. The American group included all not Spanish-speaking.
They had their balls in the new hotels, whist and sewing
clubs, dramatic society, and lodges. Saturday night was &ldquo;sluff&rdquo;
night at many saloons, and men who did not frequent saloons at
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
other times enjoyed their weekly games. There were horseback
rides, taffy pulls, tea parties, and picnics. Ladies of long residence,
dressed in their best, raised their parasols and called on newcomers.
Life, if not exciting by today&rsquo;s standards, was very pleasant. On
summer evenings parents sat rocking contentedly on the front
porches with their daughters wistfully sitting on the steps listening to
calls of &ldquo;Lie low&rdquo; and &ldquo;Run, Sheep, Run&rdquo; from the boys in all parts
of town. In the winter they sat around sheet iron stoves, mending
or reading, while the children did their home work around the
dining room table.</p>
<p class="tb">Nathaniel Bell went to Wisconsin and married the girl he
had left there years before. Red-haired Sue Bell was a welcomed
addition to the town. She was friendly and had a knack of starting
things and seeing them through&mdash;the first community Christmas tree,
for example. Mr. Bell had lost a considerable sum in the first bank
failure, and although he was distrustful, he deposited money in the
second bank. When it, too, closed its doors, Mrs. Bell said, &ldquo;The
money is yours. Go and get it for I&rsquo;m sure the bank president has
it in his home. I&rsquo;ll be standing by.&rdquo; Bell went and was told by the
wife that the president was ill and could see no one. Bell said,
&ldquo;I have come to see him and to get my money. Either he comes
out or I go in.&rdquo; The bank president came out, took one look at big
Nat Bell, went to a wall safe and took out $10,000. Bell and Stephens
were the only operators that met their payroll that month. But he
was through with local banks. Thereafter he buried his money,
keeping a record on the jamb of a pantry door. One day the storekeeper
saw a Mexican, who was digging around the fruit trees in
the yard, lean over and pick up something. He looked around,
dropped his hoe and took off. The storekeeper leaped over the
counter, called to a clerk that he was leaving, and sprinted after the
man, overtaking him in an alley. The Mexican handed over his
find&mdash;a large tomato can that had been opened with a butcher knife
and the points pushed together again. It was filled with coins and a
sticky mass, indicating that it had been in the ground through many
storms. With a warm iron and blotting paper, Mrs. Bell was able to
distinguish green backs. She sent the mass to Washington and
received more than two thousand dollars in new bills. Mr. Bell had
made no record but he was able to recall the circumstances. The
day he collected the money no one was home, he could find no other
can, so he buried it hurriedly, thinking he would find a better
container, then had been called away. The incident made him think
that perhaps he had failed to record other deposits so Mrs. Bell
superintended the digging up of the entire place. Two more cans
were found but of the baking powder variety. That started everyone
digging for buried treasure and some was found.</p>
<p class="tb">George H. Utter, before he engaged in mining, sold Singer
Sewing Machines. He drove about the county in a buckboard with
a machine for demonstrations tied behind the seat. He came to a
Mexican ranch on Whiskey Creek just east of Rocky Point the day
after the rancher had found a can of gold. He had invited several
of his friends to help him celebrate and they were making merry
when Mr. Utter drove up. The women &ldquo;Ohed and Ahed&rdquo; over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
latest model. The man showed the gold to Utter and ordered a new
machine for every woman present.</p>
<p>Edward Dehaney was a very likeable young man but
described as &ldquo;not worth $1.25 from the neck down.&rdquo; His worth was
from the neck up as he proved later in his career. While he was in
Pinos Altos he was practically penniless but full of schemes. The
Bells took him into their home and boarded him for several months
with the understanding that he pay when he could. Mrs. Bell knew
he was receiving money but he never paid a cent and left town
without doing so. Mrs. Bell collected years later. When she visited
him in his pretentious offices in California and presented her bill he
said, &ldquo;But, Mrs. Bell, this is outlawed&mdash;and you, being a lady, would
not presume to collect an outlawed bill.&rdquo; Mrs. Bell replied, &ldquo;I know
the bill is outlawed, but you, being a gentleman, will surely honor
it.&rdquo; His check went to a home for old miners.</p>
<p>When the first son was born to the Bells he was given the
family name of &ldquo;Golden&rdquo; and his father had a bell made of local gold
which Golden wore on a chain around his neck until he reached
school age. A gold brick from a run of the mill was kept on a
counter in the store. The early miners used gold as a medium of
exchange as long as they lived. It was usually carried in a small Bromo
Seltzer bottle in a pocket and a man could estimate accurately the
amount for his daily needs. As he grew older, if he needed 60 cents
for coffee and tobacco he washed out that amount, if he needed
$4.50 for overalls, blouse, flour, sugar and meat, he panned that
amount, then sat in the sun. Goods were no longer paid for by
the &ldquo;finger&rdquo; for the gold was carefully weighed. Should the amount
of gold be a little more than the bill, candy would be taken home
for the children. If it fell short a tab was made and dropped into
the till. Rarely was it necessary, and always when the man came
back to make another purchase, he would have extra gold so the tab
against him could be destroyed. In those days there were no pennies
and very few dollar bills in circulation. All costs were figured in
multiples of five and reduction in price was given if items were
bought in quantity. Men who worked for wages settled accounts
on pay day and went home with a generous sack of candy. Store
hours were from seven to seven. Usually there was a dull period
in the afternoons which the clerks used to put up beans, rice, and
sugar, etc., in 25c and 50c amounts, folding and tying the sacks for
the evening rush. Saturday was clean-up night when the delivery
boys, clerks, and handy men would take off their shoes and socks,
roll up their pantaloons, and with brooms, mops and buckets of hot
soapy water, scrub counters and floors. The Bell and Stephens
store was the largest but it was a company store. Smaller companies
and independent operators wanted other stores. Neffe had a store
at the corner of Main Street and Gold Avenue&mdash;later the F. J. Davidson
store. Men who worked at the Mountain Key and at the Golden
Giant traded there, and later the Mammoth people. The building
which housed George Norton&rsquo;s store is still standing, south of the
Buckhorn Bar. Both buildings are relics of the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Many men like Jim Hill and his brother had taken up
homesteads on the Upper Gila and along the Sapello. They traded
in Pinos Altos and drove their cattle through town to the stock yards
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
below Silver City. Merchants waited six months or a year for those
accounts to be settled but they always were. One rancher, in for
supplies, would take out coffee, tobacco and mail to all along his
way. Newspapers, no matter how old, and magazines were always
welcomed in the remote areas. Each merchant had a collection box
for them. The corrals at the stores were open to the ranchers and
often they were filled with pack animals. Trappers and government
hunters also camped in the corrals. Ben Lilly and Nat Straw were
regular visitors and once in a great while &ldquo;Bear&rdquo; Moore would come
to town. Moore had lived in a cabin at the mouth of Big Cherry
before he moved to the West Fork. He had been badly mauled and
disfigured as a result of an encounter with a bear and had withdrawn
from contacts with his fellow men as much as possible. As he told
his story, he had killed a half-grown cub in a rocky canyon when the
mother appeared around a bend. Moore&rsquo;s gum jammed and the bear
was upon him. He fought with sticks, stones and his bare hands,
unable to escape. When he regained consciousness the dead bear
was lying beside him and Moore was torn to pieces, a jaw bone and
part of his breast were gone. Looking down at the gaping hole he
said that he could see his heart beating. That he was able to crawl
to camp and receive help was miraculous. His last years were spent
prospecting in the headwaters of the Gila country and it was rumored
that he made a rich find. When his last camp was found Moore had
been dead for some time. A handful of beans, the remains of a
shank of venison, a canvas bag containing worthless rock was all
that was found. The old hermit had died of starvation and exposure.</p>
<p>The Hearst Company renovated the store with paper and
paint, arranging the stock into departments, as drug, dry-goods,
hardware, etc. A large sheet iron warehouse was added for rails
and other mining equipment. Also erected was an office building,
a mess for office and store employees, and new homes for their
foremen. The Bell and Stephens duplex was remodeled for the
Thayer and Risque families. Altogether the old town had a new
look. Stephens, before he would sign the sale papers, had insisted
that &ldquo;his people&rdquo; be given consideration and cared for, and the Hearst
Company carried out this policy. &ldquo;Chan&rdquo; Derbyshire was promoted
to be store manager and promising local boys were changed from
common laborers to store clerks&mdash;Tom Hall and Fernando Chavez
were two of them. Will Rivers and George Turner came from Silver
City to take positions. Among the men who were brought in were
Harry Thorne, assayer and Mike Riney, master mechanic.</p>
<p>When Bell and Stephens had announced the sale of their
property to the Hearst Interests there was great excitement. The
Hearsts represented money and money could do great things, but
at the same time, they were sorry to see the Bell and Stephens
families depart. The property had been turned over when Mr. Daniel
B. Jillette, Jr., representing the Hearst Interests, presented Mrs. Bell
a farewell gift, the last ingot from the Bell and Stephens Mill. This
gold has been used only for wedding rings and from the amount
remaining today it will furnish wedding rings to the Bell family for
many, many generations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c4">The 1900&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>There must have been doctors here before the &rsquo;80&rsquo;s but they
left no records. Dr. Lewis B. Robinson came to take charge of the
drug store and to care for the ill and injured. He was a character,
crude in his methods but a family physician of the old school, ready
day or night to go where ever needed. He would go to a home just
to see the folks, have the children stick out their tongues, sometimes
leaving pills or asking them to go by the drug store for a powder.
There was a &ldquo;pest house&rdquo; where victims of small pox were quarantined.
Once the case was confined there was improving and had
gone outside to sit in the sun, when he went inside he found that
his bedding had disappeared. When &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; was informed he said,
&ldquo;Well never mind, we&rsquo;ll know who took the blankets in a few days.&rdquo;
Sure enough, Joe Acosta came down with the small pox and was
marked for the rest of his life. Other doctors came and went
and for a time there was a dentist with his own office and equipment,
but usually the inhabitants depended on the semi-annual visits of
Dr. W. H. White of Silver City to have dental care.</p>
<p>The climate attracted health seekers, particularly those with
tuberculosis. Most followed a rest cure, others tried to work, some
went out to ranches. It is recalled that one young man would go
to a slaughter house whenever a beef was to be killed and drink a
cup of warm blood. Some went home to die, others were shipped
East, but there were others, like Russell Davidson who came from
Nova Scotia and was taken from the train on a stretcher, who lived
a long and active life. William Sweikert was a health seeker
(1908-1911) who was interested in the native population. He was
Justice of Peace and as such, came in contact with some quite often.
He was shocked to learn that many families had not been married so
he rounded up the men and women involved and persuaded them to
get licenses and he would perform the civil ceremonies. When that had
been done, the next step was to have the marriages blessed by a priest.
All friends and relatives gathered, children dressed in new white
dresses or blue jeans formed a procession to the church. &ldquo;Un Gran&rsquo;
Baile&rdquo; was held and the bridegrooms broke &ldquo;carones&rdquo; over the
heads of the gray-haired brides with as much ardor as much younger
gay caballeros would have done.</p>
<p>Soldiers from Fort Bayard had always ridden across the
hills, at first on duty, then to call on the pretty girls. Many passes
were issued because of a party or a dance. However, the girls were
choosy and not all soldiers were welcomed. They were admitted
to other places, however, and their trails could be followed by the
&ldquo;dead soldiers&rdquo; (large brown beer bottles) lying along the way. There
were plenty of attractive young men in town and the homes where
there were girls were hospitable. A favorite song among the boys was:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go up to Maud&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ll have a jubilee.</p>
<p class="t0">Make love to all her sisters, boys</p>
<p class="t0">But please leave Maud to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>They had the Lee home in mind where Mrs. Lee was even
more popular than her four daughters.</p>
<p>Henry Young and his brother, John, about 1900, sold their
ranch above Fort Bayard and came to Pinos Altos where they built
a livery stable. Henry is remembered for his tall tales of his own
achievements. However, he was a hard worker and the results of
his efforts often justified his stories. He had the fastest horses, the
best equipment, he raised the best vegetables and fruits. He introduced
the Stark Delicious apple to this section and won several awards
for them at state fairs.</p>
<p>Each mining company had its own engineers, foremen, and
laborers and their families joined the men. The community regretted
seeing friends depart and at the same time they welcomed the
newcomers. Often the change brought an outstanding person&mdash;such
was Mrs. Grace Griswold Adams. She was a teacher in the Milwaukee
Schools who had bought stock in the Savannah Mining
Company. For a summer vacation she decided to visit Silver City
where she could see something of what her mining stock represented.
She liked the country and the people so asked for and was granted
a year&rsquo;s leave of absence. She took a position in the smelter office
but was persuaded by Mr. F. J. Davidson to leave it and teach in
Pinos Altos. She married George H. Bisby of a pioneer Lone
Mountain family and lived here, teaching part of the time, for 36
years. She was an interesting conversationalist, being a keen
observer and well-read. Her hobbies were music and painting, she
was always ready for a bridge or a croquet game, and her home was
always &ldquo;Open House.&rdquo; A Christmas party at the Bisby&rsquo;s was something
to remember.</p>
<p>When the town was particularly prosperous a Fourth of July
celebration would be held. It began with the band parading to the
speaker&rsquo;s stand, the singing of the National Anthem, a prayer, and a
flowery, stirring oration. Then came some events for the young
fry&mdash;climbing a greased pole or catching a greased pig, foot races
and a burro race. The Ladies Aid and the Catholic Women helped
feed the crowd at noon. Restaurants served special menus and many
ate picnic lunches under the trees. In the afternoon there was a baseball
game on the regular ball grounds by the &ldquo;Gopher&rdquo; where there
was a grand stand for spectators. The drilling contest would take
place nearby on the rocks east of the Gopher dump. Fireworks
preceded the dances in the evening, rounding out a grand and
glorious day. Often bets were taken on the hour and minute that
rain would fall. Summer rains generally started on the Fourth. The
procedure was patterned after the wagers made in Alaska as to the
time the ice would go out. The one giving the nearest time won
the jackpot. The burro race was unique. Each youngster entered
his own burro but rode one belonging to someone else. The slowest
burro won, so every rider forced his mount to the greatest speed
possible.</p>
<p>After World War I many discharged men settled here, partly
for reasons of health and partly because they liked the place. Harry
Hickel, Bob Riddle and Jim Bonnelly were among them. They loved
the out-of-doors and shared in community affairs so they were
interesting families to have as neighbors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The young people among the new arrivals had to be initiated.
If the young man was a tenderfoot he was taken &ldquo;snipe hunting&rdquo;
but girls were treated in a more original fashion. They would be
invited for a horseback ride to see the mines. The hostesses would
rent horses from the miners who habitually stopped at the saloons
on the way home from work. As the returning party approached
town it was seen to that the horses were on their usual trails. In
front of the saloons the horses would come to a dead stop. No amount
of coaxing, whipping, nor under-the-breath cursing would make them
move for ten minutes, just long enough for the owners to have their
usual drinks. Then the horses lifted their heads and trotted to the
home corrals. This may not seem funny now, but it was hilarious
when a &ldquo;nice girl&rdquo; would not even glance at a bar room door. There
were no hard feelings&mdash;it was just part of the wild and woolly west.</p>
<p>Pinos Altos was not a lawless place as old mining camps
were supposed to be. There was a stout jail, first on the main street
and then moved to the &ldquo;Mill Site.&rdquo; Offenders were not confined
long. In early days if the crime was a major one justice was swift,
and if it was a petty offence one night locked up was sufficient to
sober the inmate. Mr. H. E. Muse was marshal for a time and his
presence was enough to make would-be law breakers watch their
steps. Ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, speaking from the steps
of the Eckles home in Silver City on July 11, 1913, referred to a
murder committed by one of his &ldquo;Rough Riders&rdquo; in Pinos Altos.
The man had written for help saying, &ldquo;he had killed a lady but
thought he was shooting his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Peter Wagner had not been in America long
when they came West during the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s. Another French family came
later and the two couples became close friends. When a baby was
born to the second couple and the mother died, the Wagners took
the baby girl and loved her as their own. Mrs. Wagner had been
a lace-maker in Belgium and everything she made for the baby was
trimmed with exquisite hand made lace. The Wagners wanted to
adopt the child but the father would not give his consent. When
the little girl was three years old the father left and took his daughter
with him. Mrs. Wagner grieved until she became ill and after that
was always considered queer. She would talk to herself and to her
dogs but not to people. Besides working a mine and mill, &ldquo;Pete&rdquo;
had a barber shop next door to John Oglesby&rsquo;s saloon. Bob Close
was a character who was very proud of his goatee. One day when he
came into town he visited the saloon where he imbibed freely then
went to the barber shop for a hair cut and a trim. He fell asleep in
the chair and Pete went on to other business leaving him there.
Some rascal saw him, slipped in and cut off the goatee. When old
Bob awoke, from habit, he started to stroke his goatee. It was not
there, nor was the barber, so he went raging into the saloon threatening
to pound the little Frenchman to a pulp. Mr. Oglesby laughed
and Bob accused him of the dastardly act, he swore and fingered
his face, fighting mad. It took six men to subdue him and to assure
him that the injury was not permanent. Wagner had invested in
Silver City real estate and after his death Mrs. Wagner would walk
there often carrying her shoes in her market basket, and after doing
her shopping and collecting the rents would walk back. Mrs. Oglesby,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
who sometimes drove the stage, was the only person she would ride
with. Later Henry Geitz was appointed trustee. Once he and Mrs.
Wagner made a trip to Europe together in an attempt to find relatives.
Mrs. Wagner said the persons they found were too old and
she insisted on returning. During World War I all trace was lost of
the relatives of both Mr. and Mrs. Wagner. Once when the rent was
being given her, Mrs. Wagner said that she did not want the money,
that the can in the woodpile was full. Some time later she was
beaten and robbed and died as a result.</p>
<p>Fights originated in saloons and dance halls more often than
anywhere else. Arguments started that only fist fights or gun play
would settle. Usually the participants would be thrown out before
anything serious happened. One Christmas Day, Tom Gibson, having
the fore-runner of the Boy Scouts&rsquo; good deed in mind, offered to
tend bar while John Oglesby ate dinner with his family. The loafers
thought they would have some fun with the &ldquo;tenderfoot,&rdquo; as they
regarded Tom. John kept a gun beneath the bar and Joe Acosta
went looking for it. Tom told him to keep away. That started
the fuss. Tom thought he was going to need the gun but it was not
in the usual place so he tackled the bunch and literally threw each
one out including big Valentine Gutierrez. Tom was accepted as a
right guy from that time. Some G.O.S. cowboys were on their way
back to the ranch after driving a herd to the stock yards. They had
been having a big time in Silver City and were still whooping it up
when they arrived, dropped the bridle reins and entered a saloon.
A newcomer was acting as constable that day, and carrying a shot
gun. He went after the cowboys for disturbing the peace and
escorted them to the jail. As he unlocked the door he was overpowered,
the key and his gun taken and he was locked inside. The
cowboys returned to the saloon and, leaving the key and gun, told
Mr. Oglesby what they had done and cautioned him to keep the
constable locked up over night. Old &ldquo;Plunder,&rdquo; another of the
town&rsquo;s characters, went to let the man out next morning and dubbed
him &ldquo;Shot-Gun Smith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, but my name is Alexander Keys,&rdquo;
said the erstwhile constable with dignity&mdash;but &ldquo;Shot-Gun Smith&rdquo;
was what he was called as long as he was in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Juvenile delinquency was never a great problem. Boys
always threw rocks. If a house was vacated vandals took it over.
It was &ldquo;great fun&rdquo; to tease Mrs. Wagner. It was rumored she always
carried a butcher knife in her market basket. Joe Munoz was tormented
just to hear him storm in fluent Italian. Joe had a small
store with rooms to rent above it. When it burned two men died
in the blaze and a Silver City paper reported &ldquo;that 10,000 other lives
were lost&rdquo;. Bed bugs. It is recalled that just after the Waterburys
and their associates had gone, leaving a caretaker at the property,
some youngster at school suggested that, since the caretaker was out
of town for the day, it was a good time to have a swimming party
in the Mammoth tank. He had seen the Waterburys swim there and
he knew the tank was full. Swimming togs were unknown but since
it was a boy and girl group that got together after school they
gathered up odds and ends that would serve as bathing suits for
everyone but one small girl. Finally they put her into her father&rsquo;s
hunting coat saying it was just the thing because it was water proof.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
The little girl jumped in as the others did, the pockets filled with
water, and she went to the bottom like a chunk of lead. Fortunately
the big boys got her out. Then it was suggested that each one take
a souvenir from the house. The girls selected pens from an assortment
on a desk and the boys searched for things more to their liking.
Imagine what happened when the youngsters reached home! It
was return the articles at once&mdash;or else! Never was a mile so long
as that trudged by the weary and frightened children as they went
back to the Mammoth. Pilfering never interested that particular
group again. Another gang barbequed Mrs. Wagner&rsquo;s chickens. For
a season or two the main diversion of warm moonlight evenings was
for the young people to raid orchards one evening. The next day
the girls would make fruit pies which were enjoyed with coffee and
music around a bonfire. One evening a plump forest ranger from
Alabama was with the group when they took some luscious peaches
from the old &ldquo;Stanley Place.&rdquo; The ranger put them inside his white
shirt when the group was startled and ran with them to the high
board fence at the rear of the orchard. Over he went, then with
Southern gallantry, turned to help a girl, but she hadn&rsquo;t waited for
help. She landed bang against his chest and the peaches. He did
not go on any more raiding parties. It was not known until years later
that a conscientious young engineer who roamed with the gang
would go to the owner, whether Bisby, Watson, or Young, the next
day after the forage and pay for the fruit.</p>
<p>Fire was always a hazard and in spite of a volunteer fire
department with a hand pump, hose, ladders and buckets the town
was seriously damaged on many occasions. The first big fire occurred
in 1888 just as the day shift, coming from work, reached the main
street. They dropped their lunch pails and formed bucket brigades
to the nearest wells. The smoke was seen in Cornishtown and the
&ldquo;Cousin Jacks&rdquo; came hurrying down. It was midnight before the
fire was out. The saloon keepers, whose buildings had been saved,
rolled out the barrels and told the wearied fighters to help themselves.
They did so gratefully and sat around singing until dawn.
Spanish, English, Italian and Cornish voices blended in everything
from drinking songs to hymns, from Mexican folk songs to operatic
arias. Years afterwards a man who had been there said it was the
finest concert he ever heard. The second big fire took the hotels
and several homes late in the &rsquo;90&rsquo;s. Other fires were controlled and
kept from spreading but as the years went by fewer of the houses
were rebuilt. The hotels never were. Mr. and Mrs. Louis Legros
(parents of Mrs. Alice Huff) had a rooming house, restaurant, and
bakery and they took care of transients for years. Later there were
other accommodations until a surfaced road and good cars made it
more convenient for visitors to stay comfortably in Silver City and
to drive up to conduct business, admire the scenery, and to chat with
old friends.</p>
<p>Pinos Altos was really settled by veterans of the War between
the States and veterans of other wars have had their places in the
life of the camp. Three or four young men were Rough Riders
serving with Teddy Roosevelt. A number of the boys were members
of the National Guard and as such were called to go after Pancho
Villa. The very day they were welcomed home the United States
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
declared war on Germany and they went off again. Like innumerable
towns throughout the world our town had few able-bodied men left
during World War II. From our small community twenty-five were
in service and seven made the supreme sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Gila National Forest was established in 1906 and Pinos
Altos was within the boundaries. Later the line was moved about
one mile to the north where it now is. The Forest Service bought
the old Dick Lee home, moved another building from the Burro
Mountains and constructed a station. The first ranger stationed here
was A. H. Douglas. At one time there were as many as five rangers
on duty. There was much field work to be done which required
horseback riding and packing over rough trails. Signal Peak originally
was the peak nearer the Twin Sisters&mdash;so called because there
was a signal station there in Indian days. Men from nearby saw
mills&mdash;Ripley&rsquo;s, Brownells, McMillan or Franeys&mdash;manned the station.
The Forest Service chose Black&rsquo;s Peak for its look-out. It is a few
feet lower in altitude but has a better command of the forest. Many
people now refer to it as &ldquo;Signal&rdquo;. In 1959 the Forest Service built
a road to the tower. Get permission and a jeep and drive up in
the spring when iris and locust are in bloom. It&rsquo;s a treat.</p>
<p>A ghost town should have ghosts but none walk at the present
time. However in the past there were events that curdled the blood
and made one tremble with fear. There was a strike at one of the
Pacific mines, not for higher wages, but perhaps it could be called
for better working conditions. Laborers refused to work in a certain
stope or to push the tram cars through a long tunnel from the stope
to the ore bins. In those days miners carried iron candle sticks, with
sharp points that could be stuck in the ground where light was needed.
The first thing that disturbed the workers was the disappearance of
the candles stuck along the tunnel walls before they could have
burned out. Then they began to see moving lights and they knew
evil spirits had taken over that part of the mine for no good purpose.
After the second day when no worker had entered that section a
foreman decided to get at the root of the trouble. He placed lighted
candles in the usual places and sat down to watch and wait. After
what seemed to be hours he heard furtive noises in the timbering,
then a light went out, another light began to move. With his hair
literally standing on end he held his breath. Three large gray pack
rats, each bearing a candle, the one with the unlighted candle in the
rear came into view. He let out a mighty yell. For him the mystery
was solved but it took time and traps to convince the miners.</p>
<p>Another time as the graveyard shift came to the surface the
men noticed a peculiar wavering light in the sky. Their first thought
was that Pinos Altos was ablaze. They hurried up the trail to where
they could look down on the town. All was serene. The lights were
brighter and they said long fingers of blue and green mostly reached
out, threatening the town. Making the sign of the cross, clutching
their amulets, and muttering prayers they ran toward their homes,
pausing now and then to warn their friends and neighbors. Practically
everyone in town watched and marveled at the Northern
Lights that night.</p>
<p>A woman in black walked the streets for a time. No one
knew who she was nor where she stayed. She was never known to
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
speak a word. One Sunday after the usual evening service a young
woman employed in the Thayer home and a handsome stranger were
married by Rev. Van Valkenburgh. This was the first wedding in
the new church. The couple appeared to be very happy as they
furnished and decorated their new home, and callers received a warm
welcome. A shadow seemed to fall over the home in a short time
and the gossips speculated about the reason. It was rumored that the
Woman in Black was seen walking at night near the place. Without
a word of explanation, the couple abandoned their home and secretly
left town. The Woman in Black disappeared also. The Thayers may
have known the reasons but, if so, they kept the secret.</p>
<p>The most baffling mystery was an episode that happened at
the Davidson sawmill on Cow Creek about 1915. Billy Soule was
running the mill at the time and he and his wife, Jimmie, lived there.
A wild looking young man walked into camp one evening and said
that he had been led there. Mr. Soule was suspicious but he gave
the man supper and took him to a cabin where he could spend the
night. Billy cautioned him about fire, said &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; and left
him alone, vowing to himself that he would send the young man on
his way in the morning. About midnight the camp was awakened
by cries and calls from the forest. The first thought was of fire and
everyone dashed out, prepared to fight their greatest foe. All was
calm. Then the call came again for Mr. Soule, saying &ldquo;Follow me,
follow me&rdquo;. Jimmie would not let her husband venture off without
her, so both took their guns and headed in the direction indicated
by the call. When they reached the man they found him pale and
trembling but he would not explain, saying only that the voices told
him to go up the mountain and that a light had guided him to the
spot. After climbing about a half-mile, he stopped and pointed.
Both Billy and Jimmy Soule said afterwards that they saw a light&mdash;a
sort of glow near the ground under a large pine. Reaching the
place they found a newly dug hole and in it was a human skeleton.
The man said that his mission was ended and he would be on his
way. However, Soule detained him and called the authorities. The
sheriff went out early next morning, looked over the scene, questioned
the man but learned nothing. The sheriff said the man was
too young to have murdered the man whose bones were crumbling&mdash;that
he was just a &ldquo;crack-pot&rdquo;. The hole was filled and forgotten,
the young man was taken into Silver City and sent on his way. The
mystery was never solved.</p>
<h2 id="c5">Schools</h2>
<p>Captain Tevis in his recollections of Pinos Altos as told in
&ldquo;Arizona in the &rsquo;50&rsquo;s&rdquo; tells the story of Miss Rhoda Parker, a young
woman from Iowa who came with her father and her uncle, a Mr.
McCulloch, who were interested in mining. She was the first American
woman to visit the camp and was immediately very popular with
the miners. There were seven or eight Mexican and a few half-breed
children in camp. Miss Parker thought it a shame that they had no
schooling and offered to teach them. The more enterprising men
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
suggested that each miner be taxed $2.50 to pay for her services,
and the miners, wanting to keep a young and attractive woman in
camp, heartily agreed. The school was started and continued until
the beginning of the War Between the States. However, her duties
were interrupted constantly by visits from the miners whose excuses
were a new rich find or mines for sale but whose real purposes were
proposals of marriage. She had 300 such proposals. She could not
or would not make a choice. What a merry time she must have had!</p>
<p>The next record of a school is in the early &rsquo;70&rsquo;s. Trolius
Stephens brought his bride here in 1872. She was the second white
woman and the only one for a long time. They were interested in
the welfare of the people and were instrumental in starting a subscription
school, donating the land and putting up a building which
stood opposite the present Buckhorn Bar. There are no records of
the first teachers. The terms were of five or seven months, depending
on the amount of money raised.</p>
<p>In 1886, Nellie Robbins returned to her family after spending
three years at school in Sedalia, Missouri, and accepted a teaching
position. Her parents were living at the Deep Down, a mine east of
Cross Mountain. Since she rode horseback to and from school her
first earnings were spent for a riding habit which was made for her
by Mrs. Stanley (Henry Stanley&rsquo;s mother) of green velvet. Fringed
gauntlets and a chic bowler hat completed her outfit. She changed
into school attire at the home of Judge and Mrs. English (parents
of Mrs. John Moses) where she also left her horse. Mr. Homogon
Cuebas is the only one of her pupils, so far as is known, still living
in the area.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens felt responsible for &ldquo;his people&rdquo; as he called
the miners who worked for him and their families. When weather
was bad he would have Pancho, the handy man, hitch up the mules,
gather the children, and get them to school. One winter when there
was an unusually heavy snow he had runners made for the delivery
wagon and the youngsters had sleigh rides to and from school.
Ordinarily most children walked, some a distance of three or four
miles. A few had ponies or burros, on which the younger ones
would ride. Families were large. One father came into the store
one day and said, &ldquo;The kids are all in school now, but the weather
is getting cold. They can&rsquo;t go with bare feet. Sell me one dozen
pair of shoes.&rdquo; What sizes? &ldquo;Oh, just assorted.&rdquo; Brogans came in
barrels in those days, so a dozen pair of assorted sizes were picked
out and the Schafer children came to school, proud if awkward, in
the new shoes.</p>
<p>By 1888 a larger school was needed, and again Mr. Stephens
through the Pinos Altos Mining Company, known locally as &ldquo;Bell
and Stephens&rdquo;, donated land and built on the present site. The
people of the town were very proud of the new building and in the
good American tradition would not be content until the flag was
flying over it. Men found a beautiful pine well over one hundred
feet tall in the forest, cut, trimmed and shaped it only to find that
they could not get the pole into town by oxen without cutting it.
They did so and by splicing it together again, painting it, and surmounting
it with a golden ball (made by W. E. Watson), erected the
pole ninety-two feet high. The first flag raising and dedication on
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Feb. 22, 1889, was an event attended by the townspeople. Lightning
over the years shortened the pole and the cost of keeping it in repair
caused it to be taken down after twenty years of service. The principal
of the new school was a Mr. Tilman, followed by a Mr. Miller,
W. H. Decker, Miss Lela Manville, Mrs. Grace Bisby, and others.</p>
<p>Under P.W.A. the old building was razed and a two-room
adobe erected. It was inadequate and another building was put up.
There were never more than six teachers employed during a term.
The extra classes were held in the Community Church and in the
old office building since destroyed by fire. Outstanding teachers,
as judged by pupils, co-workers, and the community were Mr. Decker,
Miss Manville, and Mrs. Bisby, who contributed not only educationally
to the locale but to the county, civically and socially. The
last teachers were Mr. W. Westwood and Mrs. Elton Robinson.</p>
<p>In the early days a board fence surrounded the playground
and the favorite game at recess was &ldquo;Follow the Leader&rdquo; along the
top of the fence. The boys also played &ldquo;Kick the Can&rdquo; or getting out
of bounds, &ldquo;Hide and Seek&rdquo; in the nearby lumber yard and wood lot.
The girls amused themselves with the old singing games. Both
groups joined in marble games, jumping rope, and walking stilts when
they were in season. Miss Manville introduced basketball and at
that time games were played on the crest of the Continental Divide.
Miss Eva McGregor drove up from Silver City once a week to instruct
and Miss Clara Upchurch (later Mrs. Will Trevarrow), who was
Miss Manville&rsquo;s assistant, coached on other days and played with
the girls.</p>
<p>As in all small communities the school house has been the
center of activities. Until the Methodist Church was built in 1898
all Protestant denominations held services there. Magic lantern
shows and Medicine Men and tight-rope walkers entertained there.
At one Christmas party Santa&rsquo;s sleeve caught fire from the candles
on the tree. He was wrapped in coats and carried out while the
small fry whimpered with fear and terror but there was no panic.
Frank Brito appeared at the homes of friends on Christmas Day none
the worse for his experience. During the depression years one
building was used as a library and recreation center and was patronized
by both children and adults.</p>
<p>Some years ago an educator wrote &ldquo;The rural school has
been a little house, on a little hill, with little equipment, where a
little teacher, at a little salary, for a little while, teaches little children
little things&rdquo;. Some progressive school people decided that was all
too true and with the American concept that bigger meant better,
thought consolidation was a step in the right direction. Pinos Altos
children now &ldquo;ride the bus&rdquo; into Silver City. That undoubtedly has
its advantages but to oldsters there is a void and they look with
regret at the abandoned buildings and sigh nostalgically for the sound
of the bell and the sight of &ldquo;Old Glory&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c6">Churches</h2>
<p>The first Catholic church was built in 1868. The adobe ruins
between the homes of Miss Ashton and Mrs. Strachbein may have
been it. There is a record of Fr. Francis Bernal having visited the
camp in 1869 where he baptized several children, one of them being
a sister of Francisco Grijalva. At the time Mesilla was the center
of the diocese and priests from there visited all ranches and small
communities at least once a year, baptizing all children born during
the year, hearing the marriage vows of those couples who had decided
to live together since his last trip, and saying masses for those who
had died. These hardy and devoted men were welcome everywhere,
for not only did they represent the church, but they brought news of
the outside world and gossip regarding persons and places in southwestern
New Mexico. They had many adventures, some tragic, some
comic and not always in keeping with the precepts of the church.</p>
<p>Many years ago an Irish-Catholic, whose given name was
Martin Luther, lived here. He said his family had lived on a small
ranch in a remote section of the country where the priest came but
once a year, and that always there was a new baby when he arrived.
One blustery and cold March day the good father appeared and after
his mule had been cared for, he turned to the rancher and said, &ldquo;Well,
Mike, I suppose there&rsquo;s a young one&rdquo;. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;A boy
and I want him christened Martin Luther&rdquo;. The good padre threw
up his hands in holy terror. After a good meal of mutton, frijoles,
tortillas and coffee the priest had not been softened and the father
insisted that &ldquo;Martin Luther&rdquo; be the name. The priest had to leave
early next morning so the baby had to be baptized that day but hours
went by in talk of various matters, frequent nips from the little brown
jug and back to the argument. The warm fire, good meal, and apple
jack had made the two men drowsy. The priest asked that the babe
be brought out for the rites and when he said, &ldquo;With what name do
I christen this child?&rdquo; the father replied, &ldquo;Martin Luther&rdquo;. The old
priest bowed his head, dipped his trembling fingers into the holy
water, tenderly placed them on the baby&rsquo;s head, and blessed &ldquo;Martin
Luther&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Church of the Holy Cross was built on land donated by
Mr. Frank C. Bell (father of James H. Bell) on what during the
&rsquo;60&rsquo;s had been the dueling ground. It was blessed on July 17, 1888,
in honor of St. Alexis, the Confessor, and has always been served
as a mission of St. Vincent De Paul Church in Silver City. Ever
since the cross was erected on the mountain by Sr. Santiago Brito in
gratitude to God for deliverance from the Indians and in honor of
Saint Helena, May 3rd has been observed as Patron Saint&rsquo;s Day. In
the good old days miners would sneak sticks of dynamite, every now
and then, into their pants or lunch buckets and hoard them for the
celebration. At sunset fires would be lighted near the church and
around the cross on the mountain. Blasts would rattle the windows
throughout the town. This might go on all night if the miners had
had a successful year. Old women told the children it was to scare
the devils away. On the morning of the third, mass was said, after
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
which a procession climbed to the cross as an act of penance. Now
the day is observed as a feast day with a dinner to which everyone
interested is welcome, then mass, and a pilgrimage to the cross as
an act of devotion.</p>
<p>The Protestant churches of Silver City sent their ministers
to hold services in the school house or in individual homes during
the &rsquo;70&rsquo;s and &rsquo;80&rsquo;s. Early in the &rsquo;90&rsquo;s a regular Methodist minister, a
Mr. Ruoff, was assigned to Pinos Altos and Central. He made his
home here and succeeded in interesting the people in building a
church under the auspices of the Methodist Extension Board. Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Bell donated a part of the Good Enough mining claim
which they owned and had patented, for the site. The ladies gave
box suppers, socials, bazaars to help raise money and the men
promised regular contributions from their wages. The Hearst Interests
were bringing in more men and more money, so a building seemed
assured. Mrs. Phoebe Hearst visited the property at this time and
became interested in the project, but she withheld her donation until
the church board and the minister agreed to have a reading room for
the miners in connection with the church, she paying the expenses.
As a matter of economy, no extra room was added but the part near
the front entrance was equipped with the necessary tables, chairs
and stands, on which were placed local newspapers, and such magazines
as the Review of Reviews, McClures, Scribners, Argosy, the
old Life and Judge or Puck. Quite a diet for miners. Not one magazine
for women or children. Mr. George Lincoln was in charge. At
first the room was not popular. When Mr. Lincoln learned that the
reason was that Catholics were not allowed to use a Protestant
church, he suggested that the Ladies Aid make curtains that could
be hung between the part used for the reading room and a part used
for worship. This was done and the result was amazing. It was a
very popular place until the Hearst people sold and Mrs. Hearst
withdrew her support. There was a change in the camp. Many men
in the more important positions and many miners followed Mr.
Benjamin B. Thayer to Santa Rita, and the Comanche Company
brought in their own men. It affected church life.</p>
<p>The Gold Avenue Methodist Church was dedicated on May
18, 1898, with the retiring pastor, Rev. Ruoff and the new pastor
conducting the service. Rev. Henry Van Valkenburgh (now retired
and living at Radium Springs) was the first pastor. He, too, served
Central as well and was very popular in both towns. Everyone called
him &ldquo;Brother Van&rdquo;. He was followed by Mr. Templin and Mr.
Mussell. After them the Methodist, Presbyterian and Episcopal
ministers came up for early morning or afternoon services. Even
after regular preaching services were discontinued the building was
used as a community center; the school held entertainments and programs
there, the Forest Service showed films, a lecturer or a troupe
of entertainers was welcome to use it. A few years ago an effort
was made to use the building as a museum but the proposal came to
naught. It has been sold to the Baptists who are using it for Bible
School during summer months and for Sunday School regularly.
It was feared that the bell would fall through the rotting platform on
the tower so it was given to a rural church near Mountain Park, New
Mexico.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Sunday School had been organized on Easter Sunday, April
21, 1889. The minutes of that meeting record that Mr. F. J. Davidson
presided, Mr. W. H. Decker was elected Superintendent, Miss Lillie
Stephens, secretary, Mrs. Stanley, treasurer. Mr. Davidson was chosen
teacher of the Bible class, Mrs. W. E. Watson of the intermediate, and
Miss Zella de Hymmel of the &ldquo;Buds of Promise&rdquo;. There were thirty-six
in attendance and a collection of $3.20 was taken.</p>
<p>Twenty years later a special Easter program was given to
observe its birthday. Names of the children who appeared in that
program and who are still living nearby are Mary Jackson (Shotwell),
Helen Hunt Jackson, Dorothy Davidson (Gray), Susie Frantern
(Kern), Jennie Frantern (Christian) and Fred Stephenson.</p>
<p>As a concession to the Presbyterians a Christian Endeavor
Society, rather than an Epworth League, was organized for the young
people at the time the church was built. That and a Sunday School
continued for many years. Music was a very important part of every
service as there were many fine voices in the community. People
lost interest in church affairs when mines closed and so many prominent
families moved away. Then, too, the general use of the automobile
and popularity of the movies furnished excuses for going to
church in Silver City or to seek diversion and entertainment of
other sorts.</p>
<h2 id="c7">Mines And Mining</h2>
<p>As long as the gulches yielded a fair return in gold there was
no so-called hard rock mining. Prospectors wandered over the hills,
sampling the surface veins. The Atlantic and the Pacific, east and
west of town, were located in 1861, also the Langston, but no development
work was done. The next year the Locke lode, later called
the Mountain Key, was discovered and years later became one of the
richest producers. Surface ores were treated in 75 arrastras during
the war years. Crude furnaces were used for the smelting of silver.
Pinos Altos gold contains both silver and lead so has never received
the highest price, being regarded at 70 per cent fine.</p>
<p>In July of 1866 Virgil Marton brought the first stamp mill
by oxen from St. Louis, also a saw mill. Both were kept busy, one
crushing the surface ores and the other cutting mining timbers and
lumber for buildings from the heavy stand of pine and juniper
adjacent to the camp. After transportation and other costs were
deducted, he and his associates averaged $10.00 a day each from the
investment and labor. Big money in those days. The next mines of
importance to be located were the Aztec, Asiatic, Ohio, Mina Grande,
Pacific No. 2, all west of town, and the Golden Giant which was
practically in town. During &rsquo;68 and &rsquo;69 the Pacific alone furnished
ores for 31 stamps and the product surpassed all expectations. From
a geological point of view most of the gold bearing ores belong to
the Cambrian period. A porphyritic dyke runs along the Pacific
slope and tends to change the direction of the veins of ore. There is
much malpais to the north and east but the old-timers believed that
gold bearing rock lay underneath. John and Jacob Long found that
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
to be true when they discovered rich veins that had been exposed
by erosion. They called their claims the Osceola Group. They
opened a shaft 60 feet deep and drifted along the vein for 70 feet,
realizing from $50.00 to $400.00 a ton. The Atlantic and the Deep
Down which adjoin the Osceola proved that rich ores were underneath
the malpais.</p>
<p>The mines were not deep nor were the mining methods
legitimate. The lead would be followed, hoping it would join another
vein where the richest ore would be found. It was &ldquo;gophered&rdquo; out.
Under the surface the quartz changed to base or sulphuric ores
which could not be successfully treated with stamps. Peter Wagner
erected a five-stamp mill and a concentrator, the first which could
treat base ores.</p>
<p>Lunger and Company sank a shaft on the Mountain Key to
a depth of 90 feet and found very rich ore. They sold the property
to General Boyle and a stock company was organized with John Boyle,
Jr., as manager. The shaft was deepened to 470 feet, exposing large
ore bodies. In 1890 when James Jackson, who later became a well-known
figure in mining circles, went to work at the Key, there were
three shifts working with 200 men employed on each. The company
built its own mill down Bear Creek where adequate water could be
piped from Mill Creek. Two dams were built across Mill Creek and
besides utilizing the water for the mill, in the winters ice was cut
on the ponds and stored in an ice house for summer use by the
townspeople. Then, as now, the canyon was a favorite picnic spot.</p>
<p>The Golden Giant, which was known locally as the &ldquo;Gopher,&rdquo;
was a good producer. It was called the &ldquo;Old Family Lode&rdquo; during
the &rsquo;60&rsquo;s and &rsquo;70&rsquo;s because it could be depended upon to furnish
gold to the populace. Even today, after the rains Chelela, Loretto
and Epifanio Cuebas find gold in the vicinity of the dump. Often
when easy gold became scarce a claim was abandoned and open to
relocation. A seventeen year old boy who had run away from his
home in Texas wandered into town one day. He watched the miners
washing gold and followed them to the store where the gold was
weighed. The storekeeper became interested in the boy and let him
have a prospector&rsquo;s pick and gold pan. Each day the boy brought
in a few colors and one day appeared with some fair sized nuggets.
Upon investigation it was found that the ground adjoining the Gopher
was open to location. The boy filed on the claim and went to work
in earnest. One day a stranger came by and after watching him
clean up at the end of the day, offered him $8,000.00 for his claim.
The boy took it and went home with his fortune.</p>
<p>Boys went to work when they were fourteen. A man with
his boys would work a property digging, timbering and hoisting the
dirt from the shaft with a windlass and bucket. The ore was carefully
sorted and any rock showing free gold was ground in a hand
mortar. The results varied. Sometimes they would make but $10.00
a day but at others the man would carry $200.00 worth of gold home
in his lunch pail. After a man had taken nearly $300.00 from the
surface of the Mountain View he decided that was all and sold the
claim for $10.00 to a Mr. Demorest. From his assessment work he
realized $390.00 and that justified development work. In a short
time he netted $20,000.00 and made more by selling while the showing
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
was good. That was the surest way of making money and many
operators followed that principle.</p>
<p>The three Dimmick brothers had homesteaded on Whiskey
Creek in the late &rsquo;80&rsquo;s. One day Clint was driving in the cows, he
picked up a stone to throw at a laggard. The weight surprised him
so he took out his knife to chip at it and found it to be native silver.
It took many months to locate its source. Then in 1892 work was
begun on the mine which they called the Silver Cell and a smelter
was erected nearby. The native silver occurred in &ldquo;chimneys&rdquo; and
when one was struck it was a bonanza&mdash;otherwise the mine yielded
little, although it was worked for years.</p>
<p>It was not until 1883 that outside capital was sought. Then
began a period of expansion with up-to-date equipment. Trolius
Stephens and Nathaniel Bell interested a group of Californians and
with them formed the Pinos Altos Mining Co., which was known
locally as &ldquo;Bell and Stephens&rdquo;. The company acquired many of the
mines, did development work and had them patented. The old Place
and Johnson mill was repaired, increased to 15 stamp capacity with
a first class concentrator, installed scales and built a tramway to the
top of the mill where ore was dumped into bins and fed to the stamps.
The camp not only hummed with activity but it pulsated with the
steady pounding of the stamps. Every independent operator and
lesser companies went to work with fresh enthusiasm from the 101
mill at the foot of the Big Hill to the Atlantic, from the Mountain
Key to the Mammoth, from the Gopher to the old Skillicorn mill.
If a necessary shutdown occurred at night the silence awakened all
sleepers in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Mr. George Hearst, who had cattle interests in the Southwest,
heard of the mines and sent a young mining engineer, Benjamin B.
Thayer, to investigate. He made a thorough examination and survey
of all property and recommended the purchase as a good investment.
Mr. Hearst died about this time and it was feared a sale would not
be made. It was in May, 1896, that Mr. Bell took the result of one
run of the mill into Silver City and displayed eight gold bricks in a
pyramid a foot high, weighing 109&frac12; pounds troy weight, and valued
at $20,367.00. It was good advertising. Bell and Stephens wanted to
sell and the Hearst heirs were interested. On August 10, 1897, the
papers were signed transferring most of the Pinos Altos mining
district and property within the town to Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, who
signed for the Hearst interests.</p>
<p>The new company concentrated on the Pacific Group, but
other mines were worked also&mdash;the Ohio, Mogul, Mina Grande. A
smelter was built below Silver City to treat the ores, hauled there
in mule drawn wagons. Articles of incorporation for a narrow gauge
railroad, linking Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon had been filed
as early as 1889 and some preliminary surveys and grading done,
then the venture was dropped. The Hearst Interests realized the
advantage of such a road and began preparations to build a road
connecting smelter and mines. A boarding and rooming house
managed by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Fox, was built on the flat below
the mines to accommodate the workers on the railroad as well as
many miners who daily walked or rode over the mountain to their
work. Many cabins were built around the boarding house and it
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
became quite a settlement. To get a supply of water the company
bought a ranch at the cienega above Fort Bayard and piped the
water from there to a reservoir at the foot of Rocky Point, then it
was pumped to another in the gap between Baldback (where the
police radio station is now), and the Pinos Altos Mountains. From
there the water flowed by gravity to the mines and to the camp just
below. When the government enlarged the Fort Bayard Reservation
all the watershed was included and ranchers had to relinquish their
water rights and sell.</p>
<p>The Hearst Company sold to the Comanche Mining and
Smelting Co. in February, 1906. The Comanche continued work at
the mines and built the long-talked-of narrow gauge. The smelter
was the Silver City terminal and from there the road wound for 23
miles around hills, across bridges and up steep grades, rising about
3,000 feet to the crest. Machinery and supplies were hauled to the
mines and ore taken to the smelter. James Roberts was the engineer.
As an attraction at a Fourth of July celebration in Silver City an
excursion over the road was featured. The ore cars were filled with
merry makers who were truly thrilled by the ride. A short time
later a party of inspectors visited the mines, coming up on the train.
Going back to Silver City the brakes failed on a steep grade. The
loaded train hurtled down the mountain, failed to make a bridge
on a curve, and piled up in a gulch. One man was killed and Mr.
Roberts was seriously injured. Thereafter only the crew was allowed
to ride. The road was extended from the mines into town. The
Keptwoman was to be the station. All work was completed but the
bridge across Bear Creek. The panic of 1907 caused a slump and
the Comanche became bankrupt. The locomotives and the ore cars
were salvaged and the rest of the narrow gauge was sold as junk.</p>
<p>The Mammoth property was leased in the early 1900&rsquo;s to a
Connecticut concern. A great deal of money was spent for which
there was little return. However, the Waterburys did enliven the
town. Besides repairing and enlarging the mill, digging wells along
Bear Creek and installing pumps, and constructing a large reservoir,
the old adobe house was enlarged, a screen porch added and used
as a living room, and water piped into the house for Mr. and Mrs.
Lawrence Waterbury, their associates and guests. Mrs. Waterbury
and her sister, Miss Hall, were close relatives of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt,
but Pinos Altos was unaware of Mrs. Roosevelt in those days.
Lawrence Waterbury was in charge of the property and tried to get
as much satisfaction and pleasure out of his duties as he did from
his polo playing back home. He brought the first automobile into
Grant County and whenever he chugged into a town a crowd surrounded
him and the car. In those days men wore long linen dusters
and goggles when motoring and the women covered their large hats
with fluttering chiffon veils. Mrs. Waterbury and Miss Hall did not
hide their beautiful clothes under unbecoming dusters, for which
the women of the town were grateful. Even little girls copied the
dresses for their dolls. Although the activity at the Mammoth was
of short duration the Waterburys left a strong imprint on the people
of the town. They began to screen the porches and to figure out
means of piping water into the homes. The women were more
fashion conscious and the men began to save for an automobile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The Comanche was succeeded by the Savannah Copper
Company and there was another spurt of activity. Many of the mines
were leased to individuals and the company worked only the Pacific
and Hearst groups. Corrigan, McKinney Company of Cleveland with
mining interests in Mexico wanted sulphides as a flux for the ores
there. They leased the Hearst and employed many men. Jimmy
Corrigan was technically in charge but he was too much of a playboy
to take his work seriously. He delighted the boys by buying baseball
equipment and playing ball with them, often in the street, and if a
ball went through a window Jimmy would send a boy with a five
or ten dollar bill to pay for the damage. Mothers with marriageable
daughters tried to attract his interest for it wasn&rsquo;t everyday that a
personable young man with $40,000,000.00 was a member of the
community. Jimmy gave big parties with guests from the surrounding
area as well as the town. He was having fun while keeping one
eye on the mining game. That was going in a satisfactory manner
until the revolution in Mexico resulted in the Terrazas property being
confiscated and a fire in the mine here caused the company to cease
operations.</p>
<p>The greatest mining excitement of the past fifty years
occurred in 1911-1914 when Ira Wright and James Bell leased the
Pacific Mines and struck high grade. For 1800 pounds of the ore
they received $43,000.00. This was said to be the richest shipment
per pound received at the mint in San Francisco up to that time.
The values, gold, silver and copper, in the ore extracted and shipped
to the smelter more than paid expenses. There is irony in the story
of the rich strike. The miners were aware of it first and quietly
and expertly did some high grading. No work was done on Sundays
but everything was locked up. However, as William Swiekert said,
&ldquo;A lock keeps honest people out.&rdquo; Mr. Wright was told that gold
was getting away from him. One Sunday afternoon, he, Jim Bell
and a party slipped up to the mine. They found that some miners
had apparently worked all night and perhaps up to the time when
a look-out had warned them of the party leaving town. More ore
had been shot down than could be carried away. Some large pieces
were left outside the shaft. For years, at night one could sometimes
hear the grinding of hand mortars. Presumably some Bell-Wright
ore had been brought out of hiding when money was needed. It was
estimated that the miners got as much gold as the operators. Mr.
Wright wanted to build an electro-static mill, and as Jim Bell was
not interested in that venture, he withdrew and I. J. Stauber took
his place. No more large pockets were found and the lease was not
renewed.</p>
<p>Other men, believing that rich ores were still in the mines,
worked them for a short time, in a small way with varying degrees
of success. J. T. Janes believed that the Hardscrabble could be a
big producer and over a period of years convinced others to the extent
that they would put money into the property. Mr. Janes&rsquo; stories
were far richer and more colorful than anything that came out of
the mine. Perhaps the rich ore is there, as it is said to be in the
Gopher, the Hearst and the Mountain Key. Mr. W. C. Porterfield
had a gigantic scheme for locating ore bodies. Through his efforts
money was raised to finance a company to tunnel Pinos Altos Mountain
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
as an exploratory measure, cutting across the many veins which
would reveal the most advantageous places to sink a shaft. Work
was started but World War I interfered with that project. The
Calumet Co. built a mill south of town but never ran more than 700
tons of ore through it. The Hazard and the Keptwoman attracted
operators; the first proved that it was well named and the second
showed that its name was a misnomer. During the depression men
flocked to Bear Creek until the scene must have resembled early
days. There were seventy or more crude rockers being used by
men trying to eke out an existence by placering. Tom Crowe used
more modern and efficient methods on his claims at the mouth of
Little Cherry and on Cottonwood Flat. Douglas White also operated
a dredge and sluices down the creek.</p>
<p>The largest nugget ever found, so far as is known, was picked
up by Fernando Cuebas in Santo Domingo. It was as large as a
hen&rsquo;s egg and contained very little quartz. It was sold to Mr. J. L.
Rollins, then of St. Louis, as a specimen for the sum of $200.00.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Group was owned and operated by George
H. Utter for a number of years. Although they are in the Pinos
Altos district they were not regarded as &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; since most of the
laborers and supplies came from Silver City and the ore was taken
there over a mule-powered railroad. Many families lived at the
Cleveland and at one time the camp had its own school. Of late
years the scarcity of water has led to the use of dry washers which
supply a topic of conversation, if little more. Water and gold may
give out but hope never does. Men and women still prospect. Mr.
Richard Allen, who wrote a history of Pinos Altos, published by
The Silver City Enterprise in 1889, estimated that $3,000,000.00 in
gold had been produced, and he predicted that that much a year
beginning with 1890 would come from the mines. The Bureau of
Mines&rsquo; Bulletin No. 5, states that: &ldquo;Over $8,000,000.00 worth of gold,
silver, zinc, lead and copper has been produced in the Pinos Altos
mining district.&rdquo; Much of the gold produced probably never reached
the government&rsquo;s great safe-deposit box at Fort Knox, Ky., but what
did is but an infinitesimal fraction of the $19,000,000,000 worth, about
one-half the world&rsquo;s gold, hoarded there. If there is gold permeating
the rocky Pinos Altos hills, and, of course, there is, it is as safely
buried as that at Fort Knox.</p>
<p>During the years 1947-1949 the U.S.S.R. Co. conducted an
explorative project, the object of which was to investigate the possibility
of lead and zinc ores at a greater depth than earlier work had
revealed. At that time the company drilled 28 diamond drill holes
in the Pinos Altos district aggregating 21,000 feet. The holes range
in depth from less than 100 feet to nearly 2,000 feet. Since 1949
the company has done a limited amount of work, mostly as assessment
work to hold the claims on the eastern edge near the Atlantic
and on another group in the vicinity of Pinos Altos Mountain. Many
of these claims have since been patented. The exploratory work
revealed ore at the depth of 500 feet which can be mined when the
need arises. This may mean that Pinos Altos will again be an active
mining community, producing lead and zinc, with gold and silver
recovered as a bonus.</p>

<h2 id="c8">The Family</h2>
<p>There was a time when asking a person in the West where he
was from was a shooting matter. Visitors today have no hesitancy
about asking that or about how long one has lived here or what
brought one here in the first place. Is it more eccentric to spend
one&rsquo;s life here than in a small hamlet in Vermont or elsewhere? Lack
of initiative or drive may be partly responsible and surely sentiment
is. Some of us just love the home place.</p>
<p>My father, W. E. Watson, came west for his health at the
age of nineteen. Friends in Wisconsin had recommended Silver City
and had given him letters to Mr. Pat Rose and Mrs. Lettie B. Morrill.
Among the first people he met was Mr. A. J. Spaulding, and for
several years they were closely associated. They made Claremont,
near the later town of Mogollon, their headquarters for many prospecting
expeditions. This was during the days of Indian raids but
they never encountered an unfriendly Indian. Once when Mr.
Spaulding had gone into Silver City for supplies and was expected
back that evening, Dad hiked over the mountains to Whitewater and
caught a mess of trout. He had returned to the cabin when a rider
came up calling out that the Indians were on the warpath and were
in the mountains and that all the people were to go to Meaders on
the Frisco River for safety&rsquo;s sake. Dad said he was expecting
Spaulding so would not leave. He took his binoculars and scanned
the hillsides. A movement far up on the canyon wall caught his
eye. He watched the brush intently and presently made out the
figure of a man, the queerest he had ever seen, more startling than
an Indian even. Surmounting the pack on the man&rsquo;s back was a
large rectangular contrivance, attached to his belt were many packets,
in one hand he carried a gun and in the other a butterfly net. Dad
went to meet him. This was the beginning of an interesting friendship
with H. H. Rusby, a botanist who was looking for medicinal herbs
for Parke Davis Co. of Detroit and also collecting specimens of flora
and fauna. Mr. Rusby had seen no Indian sign, nor had Mr.
Spaulding, who returned later that evening. They were not molested
but the next day they learned that Capt. Cooley had been killed not
many miles from their cabin.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s parents were English. His father was born at
Littleport, Cambridgeshire. He worked with his father, who was a
bridge builder, from age 14 until he came to America in 1848. He
lived in Chicago for one year, then joined in the Gold Rush the
following year and traveled overland to California and tried his luck
at Placerville. After two years of varying success he returned to
New York and crossed the ocean to his old home. In 1853 he was
married to Miss Sarah Wilson of Spaulding, in the Ely Cathedral.
They came to Chicago, later moving to Janesville, Wisconsin, where
as contractor and builder, especially of bridges for the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad, he was quite prominent.</p>
<p>On Mother&rsquo;s side of the family one of the earliest ancestors
in this country was Pieter, son of Claes, who came from Holland to
New Amsterdam in 1636. Very few of the Dutch emigrants had
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
surnames&mdash;they were merely &ldquo;sons of&rdquo;. Pieter was later identified
in the records as Peiter Claesen, who in 1655, superintended the
bowery and cattle of Peter Stuyvestant. The entry in colonial records
dated July 10, 1655, reads: &ldquo;Pieter Clausen agreed to fodder and
winter, according to custom, all the cattle which Petrus Steuyvestant
has at present in his bowery at Amersfoot (Flatlands), also to sow
all the land that is suitable for sowing, provided that he deduct from
the rent the grain sown thereon. For said service the sum of 325 gr(?)
be paid; to leave the manure of his own and the general&rsquo;s in the
bowery.&rdquo; He was magistrate of Flatlands from 1655 to 1664. When
Peter Stuyvestant surrendered New Netherland to the British, Pieter
Claesen was required to take another name or to adopt a surname
and he chose &ldquo;Wykhof&rdquo; which meant &ldquo;Household Courtier&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clerk
of the Court,&rdquo; but the family soon changed to the English spelling of
Wyckoff.</p>
<p>Little is known of the Robbins line except that great grandfather
Wyckoff Robbins was born in Ohio, married and moved to
Missouri. One son, my grandfather, Edwin Augustus, married Betsy
Hartwell in Bowen, Illinois, in 1869. The Hartwells had come from
England to Massachusetts in 1636. Later one of the family had
married a French Huguenot named Dee in New Jersey, whose family
had settled first in North Carolina. Betsy&rsquo;s mother was that Dee.
Her father, John N. Hartwell, married three times and had fourteen
children, an economic necessity in those days. One of them lost
his life in the War Between the States. John N. was a close friend
of young Abraham Lincoln in Illinois, and always supported and
admired him. One of Grandmother&rsquo;s stories recalled the day she
was sent into the field where her father was plowing to tell him of
Lincoln&rsquo;s death. They returned to the house and her father prepared
for his journey to Springfield where he went to &ldquo;pay his list respects
to a great man and his good friend.&rdquo; Grandfather Robbins had spent
nearly two years in Andersonville Prison during the war. Ill and
discouraged, he did not want to settle down with his family. Then
he met Betsy, fell in love, married her, worked as a carpenter and
made a home in Quincy, Illinois. He was restless so they decided to
take advantage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and find land for
themselves in the West as other discharged soldiers were doing.
They went to Missouri, Colorado, and finally to New Mexico. Farming
did not appeal to Grandfather but the lure and adventure of
mining did. However, he found that his trade of carpentry furnished
a better living than the mining game. After several years in Silver
City he came to Pinos Altos as chief carpenter at the Deep Down
where a St. Louis syndicate was building a mill. It was here that
Mother rejoined her family and met Will E. Watson whom she
married in 1889.</p>
<p>Like most American families we are a hodge podge of
nationalities. Members have been farmers and traveling salesmen,
doctors and ministers, missionaries and teachers. Dad tried many
things but settled for the mercantile business. He was &ldquo;store-keeper&rdquo;
and Postmaster in Pinos Altos for many years where he worked early
and late to accommodate customers, but he was never so busy that
he could not take time off for fishing and hunting and enjoying the
great out-of-doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c9">TODAY</h2>
<p>Messrs. Birch, Snively and Hicks would not recognize the
valley if they could come back one hundred years later. Gone are the
tall pines that gave the place its name; gone for the greater part of the
year are the streams where they placered for gold; gone are burros
that carried their tools and supplies; gone is the excitement of a rich
find and gone, too, are the hundreds of placer miners who followed
them seeking &ldquo;El Dorado&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Today there are approximately fifty families and a few lone
individuals living in the camp, many of whom are descendants of
&ldquo;old timers&rdquo;. They refuse to admit that they live in a &ldquo;ghost town.&rdquo;
They think they are very up-to-date because they use and enjoy
modern conveniences. Instead of smoke rising into the sky there are
TV antennas bristling over the homes. No longer do they buy wood
by the burro load and hire Jose Maria Romero, invariably with a
gunny sack over his shoulder, to cut it into stove lengths. Now they
heat and cook with butane or electricity which comes from Silver
City. No longer do they fill lamps and polish chimneys but light
their homes with the flick of a switch. No longer do they draw water
with an old oaken bucket, now just a museum piece, from a well, but
thanks to electric pumps, they have only to turn a tap. If children
but knew what they had missed, how thankful they would be, with
no wood box to keep filled, no bringing in of chips and water for
household needs. No longer do the women bend over a wash tub,
scrubbing out grime and grease on a wash board. It is only a fifteen
minute drive to a laundromat. Cars, trucks, and &ldquo;jeeps&rdquo; have taken
the places of horses, mules and burros for transportation needs and
pleasures. No more do they send first-of-the-month orders to the
company store and have them delivered. Now, finding themselves
short of margarine, or bread, or wanting a frozen vegetable, they
take the Ford or Chevrolet and drive to a supermarket. Who plays
baseball now or spend an evening around the old piano singing old
familiar songs when one can watch sports events on TV, or listen to
the radio? No longer do the men gather around the pot-bellied stove
in the store or sit on the long benches outside, settling the affairs of
the world. A favorite commentator or the pictures in Life keep them
informed, and with so many smart men in Santa Fe and Washington,
why should they worry? No longer do the workmen trudge up and
over the hills to the mines and return from their shifts in single file,
whistling and singing down the trail to their homes. If they worried
about the meager wages of former days, it was not apparent. Now
they ride in cars and trucks to their work in Silver City, Hurley and
Santa Rita, often &ldquo;cussing&rdquo; their employers or the union, depending
on their status in the industrial field. Housewives say the only
convenience they lack is an electric dishwasher&mdash;and &ldquo;who wouldn&rsquo;t
rather buy than be one?&rdquo; The most common complaint is insufficient
water for lawns, gardens and those dishwashers. If and when there
is town water Pinos Altos will be truly a suburban Utopia.</p>
